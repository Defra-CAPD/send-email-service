# Send Email Service

This is a small DropWizard based service to allow sending emails via an API object.

## Building

This library is built using the sbt assembly plugin:

`
./sbt assembly
`

This command will also run the tests in the service.

## Running

The ./go script can be used to run the service using the default local configuration.
